	<p>
		Welcome visitor, thank you for visiting my site.
	</p>

	<p>
		My name is Riley Teige. I build software, fly planes, play the trumpet, and live happily with my wife in Missouri.
	</p>

	<p>
		I work as a <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/rileyteige">Software Engineer</a> for <a href="http://vinsolutions.com">VinSolutions</a>. I'm currently developing an ASP.NET CMS for our new websites product, go-live April 1. You can see some of my personal projects at my <a href="http://github.com/rileyteige">Github</a> account.
	</p>

	<p>
		I fly <a href="http://www.ixdflyers.org/index.php/main-aircraft/c172">this plane</a> on the weekends as a student pilot, ten hours away from my private license. They have a great training program!
	</p>

	<p>
		Thanks again for visiting. I've never had a personal website before, so I'm going to learn as I go. Please check my blog for updates!
